#summary This page describes using ProxyFactory to invoke PHP scripts and automatically deserialize server response from JSON format.

= Introduction =

Suppose we have a PHP script on the server that does something and outputs the result in JSON format. Our goal is to write a native Java wrapper around that script that allows us to call it from Java application and get the result as Java object.

= Details =

In the example below we have a script that takes two parameters - first name and last name and outputs Person object. PHP code looks something like this:

{{{
<?php
  echo "{\"Person\":{\"first\":\".$_POST["first"]."\",\"last\":\".$_POST["last"]."\"}}"
?>
}}}

{{{
class Person {
  String first;
  String last;
}
}}}
